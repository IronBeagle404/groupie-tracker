# Groupie Tracker

A website displaying an artist database, allowing the user to search for concert dates and locations.

## Usage

To launch the server, simply run the main backend file with `go run main.go` or `go run .`
<br>
Once it's ready, you will be prompted with an indication of the adress where the site is hosted.

The hosting port can be changed by modifying the `PORT` line in `config/config.go`

You can also change the API adress the same way, but that would most likely break everything, so don't do that (please).

To stop the server, you can just `CTRL + C` in the console *(the terminal window where you ran the previous command)*
